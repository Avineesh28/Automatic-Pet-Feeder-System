## Automatic Pet Feeder Project

Welcome to our Automatic Pet Feeder project, designed to ensure your pet is fed timely and reliably. This innovative system utilizes a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR sensor) to monitor daytime, dispensing food according to user-set intervals. When the timer runs out, the food hatch opens, dropping food for your pet.

### Project Overview

Our Automatic Pet Feeder simplifies pet care, providing a convenient solution for pet owners. The LDR sensor precisely monitors daylight, ensuring accurate feeding times. Users can easily set the feeding intervals based on their pet's needs, guaranteeing regular and healthy meals.
